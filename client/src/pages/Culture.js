          Tanzania has approximately 52 million inhabitants and over 120 tribes

          Tanzania is found in East Africa, and the country shares its borders
          with Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, DRC, Burundi, Comoro
          islands, and Rwanda. The country also has a coastline along the Indian
          Ocean. The name Tanzania is a compound word which was created after
          the two states of Tanganyika and Zanzibar were combined to create one
          country, and the name was also changed to Tanzania. The name
          Tanganyika is derived from Swahili words Tanga which mean "sail" and
          Nyika which means "wilderness" or "plains." The name translates
          loosely to "sail in the wilderness." On the other hand, Zanzibar comes
          from two words; Zenji which means "black" in the local dialect and
          Barr which means "coast" or "shore" in the Arabic language.

            1. Tanzania Contains The Deepest Lake In Africa. Lake Tanganyika,
            one of the African Great Lakes, lies partially in Tanzania and is
            Africa’s deepest and second largest lake. About 40% of the lake lies
            in Tanzania while 40% is in DRC, and the remaining portion of the
            lake lies in Burundi and Zambia. The waters of Lake Tanganyika flow
            to Congo River and finally empty into the Atlantic Ocean.

            2. The Highest Mountain In Africa Is In Tanzania. The continent’s
            tallest mountain is Kilimanjaro, which is found in Tanzania. The
            mountain rises to 19,341 feet above sea level and 16,100 feet from
            its base to the summit. The mountain is being studied by scientists
            due to its shrinking and disappearing glaciers and icefields. Mount
            Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano made up of three different volcanic
            cones of Kibo which is the highest, Shira, and Mawenzi.

            3. The Oldest Hominid Fossils Were Found In Tanzania. Tanzania has
            played a vital role in helping us understand the evolution of the
            earliest humans. Olduvai Gorge is an essential paleoanthropological
            site in Tanzania where the famous archaeologist, Dr. Leakey, found a
            2-million-year-old skull of Homo habilis which is believed to have
            occupied the region. Other fossils of hominids have been found in
            Tanzania like the 6 million-year-old Pliocene hominid. The
            Australopithecus roamed Africa about 2 to 4 million years ago.

            the most diverse linguistically countries because, within its
            borders, more than 100 languages are spoken. Swahili is the national
            language, while English is the official language. About 10% of the
            country's population speaks Swahili as their first language, and
            about 90% speaks Swahili as a second language.

            world’s shortest war was fought in Tanzania between Britain and
            Zanzibar that lasted only 38 minutes. The Anglo-Zanzibar War began
            at 9:02 am on August 27, 1896, and by 9:40 am the British had
            declared victory.

            7. Tanzania Has One Of The World's Oldest Ecosystems. Serengeti
            National Park is believed to be the world’s oldest ecosystem and has
            not changed in more than 1 million years of its existence. The
            park's flora and fauna are believed to have experienced little
            change over the past million years.

            8. Tanzania Is Known For Its Tree-Climbing Lions. Lake Manyara
            National Park and Serengeti National Park have become famous for
            their tree-climbing lions. Thought to be a unique phenomenon, other
            tree-climbing lions have been discovered in Uganda, Botswana, and
            South Africa. The sight is not to be missed, however. It is thought
            that the lions climb trees to get a better view or to catch a cool
            breeze.

            9. Tanzania Is Home To The World's Only Carbonatite Volcano. Ol
            Doinyo Lengai is the only volcano which emits natrocarbonatite lava
            rich in minerals that fertilize the surrounding plains. The active
            volcano is part of the East African Rift. The molten lava appears
            black upon eruption due to the low temperature (510 °C or 950 °F) in
            comparison to most lava which glows red.

            10. Tanzania Is Home To Hundreds Of Species Of Animals. Tanzania is
            the largest country in East Africa and also has the world’s largest
            concentration of wild animals per square mile. The country has more
            than 430 species and subspecies of wild animals including over 300
            species of mammals, of which 14 species are endemic. Tanzania
            contains several endangered mammal species. The greatest challenge
            has been poaching of animals, particularly the elephants.
